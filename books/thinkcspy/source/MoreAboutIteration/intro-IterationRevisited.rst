Iteration Revisited
===================

.. index:: iteration, assignment, assignment statement, reassignment

.. index::
    single: statement; assignment


Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or
similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and
people do poorly.

Repeated execution of a sequence of statements is called **iteration**.  Because
iteration is so common, Python provides several language features to make it
easier. We've already seen the ``for`` statement in a previous chapter.  This is a very common
form of iteration in Python. In this chapter
we are going to look at the ``while`` statement --- another way to have your
program do iteration.
