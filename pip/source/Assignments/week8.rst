Week 8: ends March 14, 2014
===========================

For this week you have the following graded activities:

1. Do the multiple choice questions and exercises in the textbook chapters, including the ones at the bottom of the chapters, below the glossary. Don't forget to click **Save** for each of the exercises.

   * Before Tuesday's class:      
      * :ref:`Installation <installation_chap>`
   
   * Before Thursday's class:
      * :ref:`Keyword-based parameter passing <keyword_pararams_chap>`
      * :ref:`Printing and parentheses <print_tuples>`
      * :ref:`String interpolation <interpolation_chap>`

#. Turn in the reading response, by 8 PM the night before your registered section meets.

   * Read *The Success of Open Source*, Chapter 1
   * :ref:`Reading response 7 <response_7>`

#. Do Problem Set 7:

   * :ref:`Problem Set 7 online exercises <problem_set_7>` (coming soon)
   * Turn in ps7/ps7.py by pushing it to bitbucket. Instructions will be embedded in the initial code file that you will download from bitbucket. (coming soon).


.. _response_7:

Reading Response 7
------------------

Briefly define open source software in your own words.

.. actex:: rr_7_1

   # Fill in your response in between the triple quotes

   """

Weber argues that you should be surprised that there is high quality open source software out there and offers some questions/puzzles that he thinks need to be answered in ordered to explain how that has happened. Which of those questions do *you* think really are puzzling, and which, if any, do you think have obvious answers? 

.. actex:: rr_7_2

   # Fill in your response in between the triple quotes
   s = """

   """

Was there anything from this chapter you found confusing? If so, what?

.. actex:: rr_7_3

   # Fill in your response in between the triple quotes

Problem Set 7
-------------

All of the problem set instructions for this week are in the code file ps7/ps7.py.

At your terminal window, cd to your code directory, then enter the following comands:

* ``git status`` If your working directory is not "clean", make sure to save and commit all your work. 

* ``git pull upstream master`` to get the latest code from us.

* ``cd ps7``. That will connect you to the subdirectory ps7

* ``ls``. You should see ps7.py, test.py, train.txt, and test.txt

* In your text editor, edit ps7.py, which contains instructions on what changes you are supposed to make. In your command prompt, run the code file by typing ``python ps7.py``

* Don't forget to finish the workflow by committing your work and pushing it to bitbucket. See :ref:`Git workflow <git_workflow>`
