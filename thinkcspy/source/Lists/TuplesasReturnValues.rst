Tuples as Return Values
-----------------------

Functions can return tuples as return values. This is very useful --- we often want to
know some batsman's highest and lowest score, or we want to find the mean and the standard 
deviation, or we want to know the year, the month, and the day, or if we're doing
some ecological modeling we may want to know the number of rabbits and the number
of wolves on an island at a given time.  In each case, a function (which 
can only return a single value), can create a single tuple holding multiple elements. 

For example, we could write a function that returns both the area and the circumference
of a circle of radius r.

.. activecode:: chp09_tuple3

    
    def circleInfo(r):
        """ Return (circumference, area) of a circle of radius r """
        c = 2 * 3.14159 * r
        a = 3.14159 * r * r
        return (c, a)

    print(circleInfo(10))
