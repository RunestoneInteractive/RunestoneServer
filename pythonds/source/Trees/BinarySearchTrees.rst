Binary Search Trees
-------------------

We have already seen two different ways to get key-value pairs in a
collection. Recall that these collections implement the **map** abstract
data type. The two implementations of a map ADT we discussed were binary
search on a list and hash tables. In this section we will study **binary
search trees** as yet another way to map from a key to a value. In this
case we are not interested in the exact placement of items in the tree,
but we are interested in using the binary tree structure to provide for
efficient searching.
