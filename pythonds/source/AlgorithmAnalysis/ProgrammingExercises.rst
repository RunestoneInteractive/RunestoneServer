#. Devise an experiment to verify that the list index operator is
   :math:`O(1)`

#. Devise an experiment to verify that get item and set item are
   :math:`O(1)` for dictionaries.

#. Devise an experiment that compares the performance of the ``del``
   operator on lists and dictionaries.

#. Given a list of numbers in random order, write an algorithm that works in :math:`O(n\log(n))`
