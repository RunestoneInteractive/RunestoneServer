Building the Knight’s Tour Graph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To represent the knight’s tour problem as a graph we will use the
following two ideas: Each square on the chessboard can be represented as
a node in the graph. Each legal move by the knight can be represented as
an edge in the graph. :ref:`Figure 1 <fig_knightmoves>` illustrates the legal
moves by a knight and the corresponding edges in a graph.

   Figure 1: Legal Moves for a Knight on Square 12, and the Corresponding Graph     

To build the full graph for an n-by-n board we can use the Python
function shown in :ref:`Listing 1 <lst_knighttour1>`. The ``knightGraph`` function
makes one pass over the entire board. At each square on the board the
``knightGraph`` function calls a helper, ``genLegalMoves``, to create a
list of legal moves for that position on the board. All legal moves are
then converted into edges in the graph. Another helper function
``posToNodeId`` converts a location on the board in terms of a row and a
column into a linear vertex number similar to the vertex numbers shown
in :ref:`Figure 1 <fig_knightmoves>`.

**Listing 1**

::

    from pythonds.graphs import Graph
    
    def knightGraph(bdSize):
        ktGraph = Graph()
        for row in range(bdSize):
           for col in range(bdSize):
               nodeId = posToNodeId(row,col,bdSize)
               newPositions = genLegalMoves(row,col,bdSize)
               for e in newPositions:
                   nid = posToNodeId(e[0],e[1],bdSize)
                   ktGraph.addEdge(nodeId,nid)
        return ktGraph

    def posToNodeId(row, column, board_size):
        return (row * board_size) + column

The ``genLegalMoves`` function (:ref:`Listing 2 <lst_knighttour2>`) takes the position of the knight on the
board and generates each of the eight possible moves. The ``legalCoord``
helper function (:ref:`Listing 2 <lst_knighttour2>`) makes sure that a particular move that is generated is
still on the board.

    def genLegalMoves(x,y,bdSize):
        newMoves = []
        moveOffsets = [(-1,-2),(-1,2),(-2,-1),(-2,1),
                       ( 1,-2),( 1,2),( 2,-1),( 2,1)]
        for i in moveOffsets:
            newX = x + i[0]
            newY = y + i[1]
            if legalCoord(newX,bdSize) and \
                            legalCoord(newY,bdSize):
                newMoves.append((newX,newY))
        return newMoves

    def legalCoord(x,bdSize):
        if x >= 0 and x < bdSize:
            return True
        else:
            return False

:ref:`Figure 2 <fig_bigknight>` shows the complete graph of possible moves on an
eight-by-eight board. There are exactly 336 edges in the graph. Notice
that the vertices corresponding to the edges of the board have fewer
connections (legal moves) than the vertices in the middle of the board.
Once again we can see how sparse the graph is. If the graph was fully
connected there would be 4,096 edges. Since there are only 336 edges,
the adjacency matrix would be only 8.2 percent full.
