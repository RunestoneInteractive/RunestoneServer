Summary
-------

In this chapter we have looked at the graph abstract data type, and some
implementations of a graph. A graph enables us to solve many problems
provided we can transform the original problem into something that can
be represented by a graph. In particular, we have seen that graphs are
useful to solve problems in the following general areas.

-  Breadth first search for finding the unweighted shortest path.

-  Dijkstra’s algorithm for weighted shortest path.

-  Depth first search for graph exploration.

-  Strongly connected components for simplifying a graph.

-  Topological sort for ordering tasks.

-  Minimum weight spanning trees for broadcasting messages.
