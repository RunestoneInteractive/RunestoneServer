Lists and ``for`` loops
-----------------------

It is also possible to perform **list traversal** using iteration by item as well as iteration by index.


.. activecode:: chp09_03a

    fruits = ["apple","orange","banana","cherry"]

    for afruit in fruits:     # by item
        print afruit

It almost reads like natural language: For (every) fruit in (the list of) fruits,
print (the name of the) fruit.

We can also use the indices to access the items in an iterative fashion.

.. activecode:: chp09_03b

    fruits = ["apple","orange","banana","cherry"]

    for position in range(len(fruits)):     # by index
        print fruits[position]


In this example, each time through the loop, the variable ``position`` is used as an index into the
list, printing the ``position``-eth element. Note that we used ``len`` as the upper bound on the range
so that we can iterate correctly no matter how many items are in the list.

Since lists are mutable, it is often desirable to traverse a list, modifying
each of its elements as you go. The following code squares all the numbers from ``1`` to
``5`` using iteration by position.

.. activecode:: chp09_for4

    numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
    print numbers

    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        numbers[i] = numbers[i]**2

    print numbers

Take a moment to think about ``range(len(numbers))`` until you understand how
it works. In this case, since ``len(numbers)`` is 5, it's the same as saying ``range(5)``.
We are interested here in both the *value* (10, 20, 30, etc.) and its *index* within the
list (0, 1, 2, etc.), so that we can assign a new value to the position in the list.

.. mchoicemf:: test_question9_16_1
   :answer_a: [4,2,8,6,5]
   :answer_b: [4,2,8,6,5,5]
   :answer_c: [9,7,13,11,10]
   :answer_d: Error, you cannot concatenate inside an append.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: 5 is added to each item before the append is peformed.
   :feedback_b: There are too many items in this list.  Only 5 append operations are performed.
   :feedback_c: Yes, the for loop processes each item of the list.  5 is added before it is appended to blist.
   :feedback_d: 5 is added to each item before the append is performed.
   
   What is printed by the following statements?
   
   .. code-block:: python

     alist = [4,2,8,6,5]
     blist = [ ]
     for item in alist:
        blist.append(item+5)
     print blist
