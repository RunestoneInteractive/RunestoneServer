        .. tab:: Question

            Write code that asks the user to enter a numeric score (0-100). In response, it should print out the score and 
            corresponding letter grade, according to the table below.
        
            .. table::
        
               =======   =====
               Score     Grade
               =======   =====
               >= 90     A
               [80-90)   B
               [70-80)   C
               [60-70)   D
               < 60      F
               =======   =====
        
            The square and round brackets denote closed and open intervals.
            A closed interval includes the number, and open interval excludes it.   So 79.99999 gets grade C , but 80 gets grade B.

               print "Score", fl_sc, "gets a grade of", gr
                 
            


#.  A year is a **leap year** if it is divisible by 4, unless it is a century that is not divisible by 400.
    Write code that asks the user to input a year and output True if it's a leap year, or False otherwise. Use if statements.
    
    Here are some examples of what the output should be for various inputs.
    
    .. table::
    
         =======  =====
         Year     Leap?
         =======  =====
         1944     True
         2011     False
         1986     False
         1800     False     
         1900     False
         2000     True
         2056     True
         =======  =====
