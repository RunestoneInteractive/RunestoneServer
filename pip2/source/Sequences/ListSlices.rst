List Slices
-----------

The slice operation we saw with strings also work on lists.  Remember that the first index is the starting point for the slice and the second number is one index past the end of the slice (up to but not including that element).  Recall also
that if you omit the first index (before the colon), the slice starts at the
beginning of the sequence. If you omit the second index, the slice goes to the
end of the sequence.

.. activecode:: chp09_6
    
    a_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
    print a_list[1:3]
    print a_list[:4]
    print a_list[3:]
    print a_list[:]

**Check your understanding**

.. mchoicemf:: test_question9_6_1
   :answer_a: [ [ ], 3.14, False]
   :answer_b: [ [ ], 3.14]
   :answer_c: [ [56, 57, "dog"], [ ], 3.14, False]
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Yes, the slice starts at index 4 and goes up to and including the last item.
   :feedback_b: By leaving out the upper bound on the slice, we go up to and including the last item.
   :feedback_c: Index values start at 0.
   
   What is printed by the following statements?
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
     alist = [3, 67, "cat", [56, 57, "dog"], [ ], 3.14, False]
     print alist[4:]
