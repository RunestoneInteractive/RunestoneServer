    tuple
        A type of sequence, much like a list but immutable. A tuple is created
        by enclosing one or more values in parentheses, separated by commas.

    packing
        When multiple values are specified, separated by commas, they are
        packed into a tuple.
        
    unpacking
        When a tuple is assigned to a collection of variable names separated
        by commas, the tuple is unpacked and the separate values are assigned to each 
        of the variables.
        
    pair
        A tuple with exactly two items.
