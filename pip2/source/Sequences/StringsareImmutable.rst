Strings are Immutable
---------------------

One final thing that makes strings different from some other Python collection types is that
you are not allowed to modify the individual characters in the collection.  It is tempting to use the ``[]`` operator on the left side of an assignment,
with the intention of changing a character in a string.  For example, in the following code, we would like to change the first letter of ``greeting``.

.. activecode:: cg08_imm1
    
    greeting = "Hello, world!"
    greeting[0] = 'J'            # ERROR!
    print greeting

Instead of producing the output ``Jello, world!``, this code produces the
runtime error ``TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment``.

Strings are **immutable**, which means you cannot change an existing string. The
best you can do is create a new string that is a variation on the original.

.. activecode:: ch08_imm2
    
    greeting = "Hello, world!"
    newGreeting = 'J' + greeting[1:]
    print newGreeting
    print greeting           # same as it was

The solution here is to concatenate a new first letter onto a slice of
``greeting``. This operation has no effect on the original string.

**Check your understanding**

.. mchoicemf:: test_question8_7_1
   :answer_a: Ball
   :answer_b: Call
   :answer_c: Error
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Assignment is not allowed with strings.
   :feedback_b: Assignment is not allowed with strings.
   :feedback_c: Yes, strings are immutable.

   What is printed by the following statements:
   
   .. code-block:: python

      s = "Ball"
      s[0] = "C"
      print s



.. index::
    single: in operator
    single: operator; in
