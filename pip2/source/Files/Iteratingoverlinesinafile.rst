Iterating over lines in a file
------------------------------

We will now use this file as input in a program that will do some data
processing. In the program, we will examine each line of the file and
print it with some additional text. Because ``readlines()`` returns a list of lines of text, we can use the *for* loop to iterate through each line of
the file.

A **line** of a file is defined to be a sequence of characters up to and
including a special character called the **newline** character. If you
evaluate a string that contains a newline character you will see the
character represented as ``\n``. If you print a string that contains a
newline you will not see the ``\n``, you will just see its effects (a carriage return). When
you are typing a Python program and you press the enter or return key on
your keyboard, the editor inserts a newline character into your text at
that point.

As the *for* loop iterates through each line of the file the loop
variable will contain the current line of the file as a string of
characters. The general pattern for processing each line of a text file
is as follows:

::

        for line in myFile.readlines():
            statement1
            statement2
            ...

To process all of our quarterback data, we will use a *for* loop to iterate over the lines of the file. Using
the ``split`` method, we can break each line into a list containing all the fields of interest about the
quarterback. We can then take the values corresponding to first name, lastname, and passer rating to
construct a simple sentence.


.. activecode:: files_for

    qbfile = open("qbdata.txt","r")

    for aline in qbfile.readlines():
        values = aline.split()
        print 'QB ', values[0], values[1], 'had a rating of ', values[10]

    qbfile.close()

To make the code a little simpler, and to allow for more efficient processing, Python provides a built-in way to iterate through the contents of a file one line at a time, without first reading them all into a list. I have found that this is confusing to students initially, so I don't recommend doing it this way, until you get a little more comfortable with python. But this idiom is preferred by Python programmers, so you should be prepared to read it. And when you start dealing with big files, you may notice the efficiency gains of using it.

.. activecode:: files_for

    qbfile = open("qbdata.txt","r")

    for aline in qbfile:
        values = aline.split()
        print 'QB ', values[0], values[1], 'had a rating of ', values[10]

    qbfile.close()
