Activities through 4/12
=======================

You have the following graded activities:

1. Class prep. Don't forget: always access the textbook by clicking on the Textbook link from cTools, so that you'll be logged in and get credit for doing the prep.
   
   * Before Monday's class: 
       * Read :ref:`Test cases<test_cases_chap>` and do the exercises in the chapter
   
   * Before Wednesday's class:
      * Review the new section on :ref:`Debugging nested data <debug_nested_chap>`   
      * Review the two sections on debugging that deal with
         * :ref:`Strategy for writing a program <build_program_chap>`
         * :ref:`Understanding code <understand_code_chap>`
      * Do the bonus Problem Set 12.
        
2. Reading responses

   * By Tuesday midnight: 
      * Read *The Success of Open Source*, Chapter 5
      * :ref:`Reading response 12 <reading_response_12>`

3. Problem set **Due:** **Sunday, April 12**

   * This week, there will be a file called ps11.py. You should download a copy of it. You will edit it on your laptop or workstation and test it by running it using your native Python interpreter.
   * If you put ps11.py in a different directory than ps7.py, you will also need to download a copy of test106.py into the directory where you put ps10.py.
   
   * There is also a bonus problem set, PS12, which I encourage you to do, especially if you want to check your understanding of the test cases material, or if you want to replace one of your lower problem set scores (remember that your 10 best problem set scores are the ones that will be counted toward your final grade.) It is due on Wednesday, 4/8.  


Reading Response
----------------

.. _reading_response_12:

Answer the following questions. 

1. Weber argues that there are several motivations for people to contribute to open source projects. Which of these do you find most plausible? Which least?

#. At an aggregate level, rather than an individual level, Weber argues that because open source projects are "antirival" goods, they can survive having only a small fraction of the participants making positive contributions. First, define "antirival" in your own words. Then say whether you think Weber's argument would work just as well for a "nonrival" good as for an "antirival" good.
