#. Reading responses

      * Read about the `Drupal open source community <https://medium.com/@heyrocker/this-article-was-originally-a-keynote-presentation-at-the-pacific-northwest-drupal-summit-in-5e7c7f93131b>`_. Drupal is a "Content Management System" that makes it relatively easy to develop websites that have dynamic content and interactive features like commenting and tagging. Note: it may be helpful in reading the article to know that "Dries" is `Dries Buytaert <http://buytaert.net/>`_, the person who started Drupal and "webchick" is the username chosen by `Angie Byron <http://www.webchick.net/about>`_, a prominent member of the community.

#. Problem set

   * This week, there will be a file called ps11.py. You should download a copy of it. You will edit it on your laptop or workstation and test it by running it using your native Python interpreter.
   * If you put ps11.py in a different directory than ps7.py, you will also need to download a copy of test.py into the directory where you put ps11.py.
