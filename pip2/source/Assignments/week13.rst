Activities through 4/19
=======================

You have the following graded activities:

1. Class prep. Don't forget: always access the textbook by clicking on the Textbook link from cTools, so that you'll be logged in and get credit for doing the prep.
   
   * Before Monday's class: 
      * Read external tutorial about `UNIX regular expressions with grep <https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-speakingunix9/>`_. 
         * Try this `interactive tutorial <http://regexone.com/lesson/9>`_ to practice writing some regular expressions
         * From the bash shell command line, execute some grep regular expressions on your code files. Challenge: write one to find lines of code that contain any for loop lines that don't end with a colon (if you have any).
      
      * Read external tutorial about `regular expressions in Python <https://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html>`_
         * Optional: write a file with python code that executes some of the regular expressions in the tutorial.

      * Read about `Paging in Twitter API requests <https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/timelines>`_ Paging is necessary when the site only gives you one *page* of results at a time, and you have to make another request to get more. There's some commented out code in the oauth_with_twitter.py file that's available on cTools. It gives a concrete instantiation of how to do paging on Twitter timelines. Other sites handle paging slightly differently; you'll have to read the documentation. In class, we'll take a look at paging for Twitter and Facebook.
   
   * Before Wednesday's class:
         * Read a little about the `Natural Language ToolKit <http://www.nltk.org/>`_.  This will prepare you for Jackie's awesome demo in class on Thursday, where she makes a madlib generator in just a few lines of code.
         * Read the subsections on Encoding under Algorithm and Example in the Wikipedia page on `Lempel-Ziv-Welch Compression <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch>`_     
        
2. Reading responses

   * By Tuesday midnight: 
      * Read *The Success of Open Source*, Chapter 6
      * :ref:`Reading response 13 <reading_response_13>`



Reading Response
----------------

.. _reading_response_13:

Answer the following questions. 

1. On p. 176-177, Weber describes "flaming" and "shunning" as ways to sanction developers who don't behave properly in an open source project. Referring back to the benefits from (motivations for) participation in the previous chapter, which benefits could effectively be taken away from developers through flaiming and shunning? 

#. Any new thoughts on GPL vs. BSD licenses from revisiting them in this chapter?
