Activities through 4/5
======================

You have the following graded activities:

1. Class prep. Don't forget: always access the textbook by clicking on the Textbook link from cTools, so that you'll be logged in and get credit for doing the prep.
   
   * Before Monday's class: 
      * Read :ref:`List comprehensions<list_comp_chap>` and do the exercises in the chapter
   
   * Before Wednesday's class:
       * Download the code file from cTools, oauth_with_twitter.py
       * Follow the instructions in it to create an app for yourself on dev.twitter.com
       * Understand and run the code
       * Answer the question :ref:`below <twitter_oauth_checkin>`
        
2. Reading responses

   * By Tuesday midnight: 
      * Read *The Success of Open Source*, Chapter 4
      * Read about the `Drupal open source community <https://medium.com/@heyrocker/this-article-was-originally-a-keynote-presentation-at-the-pacific-northwest-drupal-summit-in-5e7c7f93131b>`_. Drupal is a "Content Management System" that makes it relatively easy to develop websites that have dynamic content and interactive features like commenting and tagging. Note: it may be helpful in reading the article to know that "Dries" is `Dries Buytaert <http://buytaert.net/>`_, the person who started Drupal and "webchick" is the username chosen by `Angie Byron <http://www.webchick.net/about>`_, a prominent member of the community. 
      * :ref:`Reading response 11 <reading_response_11>`

3. Problem set **Due:** **Sunday, April 5**

   * This week, there will be a file called ps10.py. You should download a copy of it. You will edit it on your laptop or workstation and test it by running it using your native Python interpreter.
   * If you put ps10.py in a different directory than ps7.py, you will also need to download a copy of test106.py into the directory where you put ps10.py.


Reading Response
----------------

.. _reading_response_11:

Answer the following questions. 

1. The chapter describes forking as something that could fragment developer efforts and thus slow down progress of a project. If you tried to make a "fork" of Linux today, would it be technically feasible to do so? What do you think would happen?

#. Pages 116-119 describes the genesis of "Bitkeeper", which later was replaced by git. Why would the promise of switching to use something like git have helped to defuse a potential forking of the Linux project?

#. What seems similar and what seems different between the Linux project's developer community and the Drupal project's developer community?
