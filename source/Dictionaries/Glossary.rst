    dictionary
        A collection of key-value pairs that maps from keys to values. The keys
        can be any immutable type, and the values can be any type.

    key
        A data item that is *mapped to* a value in a dictionary. Keys are used
        to look up values in a dictionary.

    key-value pair
        One of the pairs of items in a dictionary. Values are looked up in a
        dictionary by key.
        
    mapping type
        A mapping type is a data type comprised of a collection of keys and
        associated values. Python's only built-in mapping type is the
        dictionary.  Dictionaries implement the
        `associative array <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array>`__
        abstract data type.
