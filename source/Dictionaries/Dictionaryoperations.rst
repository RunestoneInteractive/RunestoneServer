Dictionary operations
---------------------

The ``del`` statement removes a key-value pair from a dictionary. For example,
the following dictionary contains the names of various fruits and the number of
each fruit in stock.  If someone buys all of the pears, we can remove the entry from the dictionary.

.. codelens:: ch12_dict4
    
    inventory = {'apples': 430, 'bananas': 312, 'oranges': 525, 'pears': 217}
    
    del inventory['pears']


Dictionaries are also mutable.  As we've seen before with lists, this means that the dictionary can
be modified by referencing an association on the left hand side of the assignment statement.  In the previous
example, instead of deleting the entry for ``pears``, we could have set the inventory to ``0``.

.. codelens:: ch12_dict4a
    
    inventory = {'apples': 430, 'bananas': 312, 'oranges': 525, 'pears': 217}
    
    inventory['pears'] = 0



Similarily,
a new shipment of 200 bananas arriving could be handled like this.

.. codelens:: ch12_dict5

    inventory = {'apples': 430, 'bananas': 312, 'oranges': 525, 'pears': 217}    
    inventory['bananas'] = inventory['bananas'] + 200


    numItems = len(inventory)

Notice that there are now 512 bananas---the dictionary has been modified.  Note also that the ``len`` function also works on dictionaries.  It returns the number
of key-value pairs:




**Check your understanding**

.. mchoicemf:: test_question11_2_1
   :answer_a: 12
   :answer_b: 0
   :answer_c: 18
   :answer_d: Error, there is no entry with mouse as the key.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: 12 is associated with the key cat.
   :feedback_b: The key mouse will be associated with the sum of the two values.
   :feedback_c: Yes, add the value for cat and the value for dog (12 + 6) and create a new entry for mouse.
   :feedback_d: Since the new key is introduced on the left hand side of the assignment statement, a new key-value pair is added to the dictionary.
   
   
   What is printed by the following statements?
   
   .. sourcecode:: python

     mydict = {"cat":12, "dog":6, "elephant":23}
     mydict["mouse"] = mydict["cat"] + mydict["dog"]
     print(mydict["mouse"])
