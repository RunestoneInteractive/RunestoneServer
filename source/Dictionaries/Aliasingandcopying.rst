Aliasing and copying
--------------------

Because dictionaries are mutable, you need to be aware of aliasing (as we saw with lists).  Whenever
two variables refer to the same dictionary object, changes to one affect the other.
For example, ``opposites`` is a dictionary that contains pairs
of opposites.

.. activecode:: ch12_dict11
    
    opposites = {'up': 'down', 'right': 'wrong', 'true': 'false'}
    alias = opposites

    print(alias is opposites)

    alias['right'] = 'left'
    print(opposites['right'])
    


As you can see from the ``is`` operator, ``alias`` and ``opposites`` refer to the same object.

If you want to modify a dictionary and keep a copy of the original, use the dictionary 
``copy`` method.  Since *acopy* is a copy of the dictionary, changes to it will not effect the original.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    acopy = opposites.copy()
    acopy['right'] = 'left'    # does not change opposites

**Check your understanding**

.. mchoicemf:: test_question11_4_1
   :answer_a: 23
   :answer_b: None
   :answer_c: 999
   :answer_d: Error, there are two different keys named elephant.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: mydict and yourdict are both names for the same dictionary.  
   :feedback_b: The dictionary is mutable so changes can be made to the keys and values.
   :feedback_c: Yes, since yourdict is an alias for mydict, the value for the key elephant has been changed.
   :feedback_d: There is only one dictionary with only one key named elephant.  The dictionary has two different names, mydict and yourdict.
   
   What is printed by the following statements?
   
   .. sourcecode:: python

     mydict = {"cat":12, "dog":6, "elephant":23, "bear":20}
     yourdict = mydict
     yourdict["elephant"] = 999
     print(mydict["elephant"])
