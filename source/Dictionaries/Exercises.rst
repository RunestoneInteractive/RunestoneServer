        .. tab:: Question

           Write a program that reads in a string on the command line and returns a
           table of the letters of the alphabet in alphabetical order which occur in
           the string together with the number of times each letter occurs. Case should 
           be ignored. A sample run of the program would look this this::
        
               $ python letter_counts.py "ThiS is String with Upper and lower case Letters."
               a  2
               c  1
               d  1
               e  5
               g  1
               h  2

#. Give the Python interpreter's response to each of the following from a
   continuous interpreter session:

   a.
      .. sourcecode:: python
        
          >>> d = {'apples': 15, 'bananas': 35, 'grapes': 12} 
          >>> d['banana'] 

   b.
      .. sourcecode:: python
        
          >>> d['oranges'] = 20
          >>> len(d) 

   c.
      .. sourcecode:: python
        
          >>> 'grapes' in d
          
   d.
      .. sourcecode:: python
        
          >>> d['pears']
          
   e.
      .. sourcecode:: python
        
          >>> d.get('pears', 0)
          
   f.
      .. sourcecode:: python
        
          >>> fruits = d.keys()
          >>> fruits.sort()
          >>> print(fruits)
          
   g.
      .. sourcecode:: python
        
          >>> del d['apples']
          >>> 'apples' in d 
          

   Be sure you understand why you get each result. Then apply what you
   have learned to fill in the body of the function below:

   .. sourcecode:: python
    
       def add_fruit(inventory, fruit, quantity=0): 
            pass
       
       # make these tests work...
       new_inventory = {}
       add_fruit(new_inventory, 'strawberries', 10)
       test('strawberries' in new_inventory, True)
       test(new_inventory['strawberries'], 10)
       add_fruit(new_inventory, 'strawberries', 25)
       test(new_inventory['strawberries'] , 35)

    .. tabbed:: q3

        .. tab:: Question

           Write a program called ``alice_words.py`` that creates a text file named
           ``alice_words.txt`` containing an alphabetical listing of all the words, and the
           number of times each occurs, in the text version of `Alice's Adventures in Wonderland`.  
           (You can obtain a free plain text version of the book, along with many others, from 
           http://www.gutenberg.org.) The first 10 lines of your output file should look
           something like this
        
            =========== ===========
            Word              Count
            =========== ===========
            a                 631
            a-piece           1
            abide             1
            able              1
            about             94
            above             3
            absence           1
            absurd            2
            =========== ===========
        
           How many times does the word, ``alice``, occur in the book?  If you are writing this 
           in the activecode window simply print out the results rather than write them to a file.
