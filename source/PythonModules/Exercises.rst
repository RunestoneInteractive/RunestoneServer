        .. tab:: Question

           The **Pythagorean Theorem** tells us that the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is related to the lengths of the other two sides.  Look thru the ``math`` module and see if you can find a function that will compute this relationship for you.  Once you find it, write a short program to try it out.

            .. activecode:: mod_q3_answer
            
               import math
            
               side1 = 3
               side2 = 4
               hypotenuse = math.hypot(side1,side2)
               print(hypotenuse)

#.  Search on the internet for a way to calculate an approximation for **pi**.  There are many that use simple arithmetic.  Write a program to compute the approximation and then print that value as well as the value of ``math.pi`` from the math module.
