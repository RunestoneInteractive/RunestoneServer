Tuple Assignment
----------------

Python has a very powerful **tuple assignment** feature that allows a tuple of variables 
on the left of an assignment to be assigned values from a tuple
on the right of the assignment.

.. sourcecode:: python

    (name, surname, birth_year, movie, movie_year, profession, birth_place) = julia

This does the equivalent of seven assignment statements, all on one easy line.  
One requirement is that the number of variables on the left must match the number
of elements in the tuple. 

Once in a while, it is useful to swap the values of two variables.  With
conventional assignment statements, we have to use a temporary variable. For
example, to swap ``a`` and ``b``:

.. sourcecode:: python

    temp = a
    a = b
    b = temp

Tuple assignment solves this problem neatly:

.. sourcecode:: python

    (a, b) = (b, a)

The left side is a tuple of variables; the right side is a tuple of values.
Each value is assigned to its respective variable. All the expressions on the
right side are evaluated before any of the assignments. This feature makes
tuple assignment quite versatile.

Naturally, the number of variables on the left and the number of values on the
right have to be the same.

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> (a, b, c, d) = (1, 2, 3)
    ValueError: need more than 3 values to unpack 

.. index::
    single: tuple; return value
