Lists and ``for`` loops
-----------------------

It is also possible to perform **list traversal** using iteration by item as well as iteration by index.


.. activecode:: chp09_03a

    fruits = ["apple","orange","banana","cherry"]

    for afruit in fruits:     # by item
        print(afruit)

It almost reads like natural language: For (every) fruit in (the list of) fruits,
print (the name of the) fruit.

We can also use the indices to access the items in an iterative fashion.

.. activecode:: chp09_03b

    fruits = ["apple","orange","banana","cherry"]

    for position in range(len(fruits)):     # by index
        print(fruits[position])


In this example, each time through the loop, the variable ``position`` is used as an index into the
list, printing the ``position``-eth element. Note that we used ``len`` as the upper bound on the range
so that we can iterate correctly no matter how many items are in the list.




Any sequence expression can be used in a ``for`` loop.  For example, the ``range`` function returns a sequence of integers.

.. activecode:: chp09_for3
    
    for number in range(20):
        if number % 3 == 0:
            print(number)


This example prints all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 19.

Since lists are mutable, it is often desirable to traverse a list, modifying
each of its elements as you go. The following code squares all the numbers from ``1`` to
``5`` using iteration by position.

.. activecode:: chp09_for4

    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    print(numbers)

    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        numbers[i] = numbers[i]**2

    print(numbers)

Take a moment to think about ``range(len(numbers))`` until you understand how
it works. We are interested here in both the *value* and its *index* within the
list, so that we can assign a new value to it.


    
    
    

**Check your understanding**

.. mchoicemf:: test_question9_16_1
   :answer_a: [4,2,8,6,5]
   :answer_b: [4,2,8,6,5,5]
   :answer_c: [9,7,13,11,10]
   :answer_d: Error, you cannot concatenate inside an append.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: 5 is added to each item before the append is peformed.
   :feedback_b: There are too many items in this list.  Only 5 append operations are performed.
   :feedback_c: Yes, the for loop processes each item of the list.  5 is added before it is appended to blist.
   :feedback_d: 5 is added to each item before the append is performed.
   
   What is printed by the following statements?
   
   .. code-block:: python

     alist = [4,2,8,6,5]
     blist = [ ]
     for item in alist:
        blist.append(item+5)
     print(blist)
