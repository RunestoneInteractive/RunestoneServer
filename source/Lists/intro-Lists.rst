Introduction: Lists
=====

A **list** is a sequential collection of Python data values, where each value is identified by an
index. The values that make up a list are called its **elements**. Lists are
similar to strings, which are ordered collections of characters, except that the
elements of a list can have any type and for any one list, the items can be of different types.
