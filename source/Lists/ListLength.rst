List Length
-----------

As with strings, the function ``len`` returns the length of a list (the number
of items in the list).  However, since lists can have items which are themselves lists, it important to note
that ``len`` only returns the top-most length.  In other words, sublists are considered to be a single
item when counting the length of the list.

.. activecode:: chp09_01a

    alist =  ["hello", 2.0, 5, [10, 20]]
    print(len(alist))
    print(len(['spam!', 1, ['Brie', 'Roquefort', 'Pol le Veq'], [1, 2, 3]]))

.. mchoicemf:: test_question9_2_1 
   :answer_a: 4
   :answer_b: 5
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: len returns the actual number of items in the list, not the maximum index value.
   :feedback_b: Yes, there are 5 items in this list.

   What is printed by the following statements?
   
   .. code-block:: python

     alist = [3, 67, "cat", 3.14, False]
     print(len(alist))
   
   
.. mchoicemf:: test_question9_2_2
   :answer_a: 7
   :answer_b: 8
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Yes, there are 7 items in this list even though two of them happen to also be lists.
   :feedback_b: len returns the number of top level items in the list.  It does not count items in sublists.

   What is printed by the following statements?
   

   .. code-block:: python

      alist = [3, 67, "cat", [56, 57, "dog"], [ ], 3.14, False]
      print(len(alist))
