Strings and Lists
-----------------

Two of the most useful methods on strings involve lists of
strings. The ``split`` method
breaks a string into a list of words.  By
default, any number of whitespace characters is considered a word boundary.

.. activecode:: ch09_split1
    
    song = "The rain in Spain..."
    wds = song.split()
    print(wds)

An optional argument called a **delimiter** can be used to specify which
characters to use as word boundaries. The following example uses the string
``ai`` as the delimiter:

.. activecode:: ch09_split2
    
    song = "The rain in Spain..."
    wds = song.split('ai')
    print(wds)

Notice that the delimiter doesn't appear in the result.

The inverse of the ``split`` method is ``join``.  You choose a
desired **separator** string, (often called the *glue*) 
and join the list with the glue between each of the elements.

.. activecode:: ch09_join

    wds = ["red", "blue", "green"]
    glue = ';'
    s = glue.join(wds)
    print(s)
    print(wds)

    print("***".join(wds))
    print("".join(wds))


The list that you glue together (``wds`` in this example) is not modified.  Also, 
you can use empty glue or multi-character strings as glue.



**Check your understanding**

.. mchoicemf:: test_question9_22_1
   :answer_a: Poe
   :answer_b: EdgarAllanPoe
   :answer_c: EAP
   :answer_d: William Shakespeare
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Three characters but not the right ones.  namelist is the list of names.
   :feedback_b: Too many characters in this case.  There should be a single letter from each name.
   :feedback_c: Yes, split creates a list of the three names.  The for loop iterates thru the names and creates a string from the first characters.
   :feedback_d: That does not make any sense.
   
   What is printed by the following statements?
   
   .. code-block:: python

     myname = "Edgar Allan Poe"
     namelist = myname.split()
     init = ""
     for aname in namelist:
        init = init + aname[0]
     print(init)
