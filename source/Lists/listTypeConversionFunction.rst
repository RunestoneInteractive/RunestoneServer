``list`` Type Conversion Function
---------------------------------
    
Python has a built-in type conversion function called 
``list`` that tries to turn whatever you give it
into a list.  For example, try the following:

.. activecode:: ch09_list1
    
    xs = list("Crunchy Frog")
    print(xs)


The string "Crunchy Frog" is turned into a list by taking each character in the string and placing it in a list.  In general, any sequence can be turned into a list using this function.  The result will be a list containing the elements in the original sequence.  It is not legal to use the ``list`` conversion function on any argument that is not a sequence.

It is also important to point out that the ``list`` conversion function will place each element of the original sequence in the new list.  When working with strings, this is very different than the result of the ``split`` method.  Whereas ``split`` will break a string into a list of "words", ``list`` will always break it into a list of characters.
