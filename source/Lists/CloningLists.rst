Cloning Lists
-------------

If we want to modify a list and also keep a copy of the original, we need to be
able to make a copy of the list itself, not just the reference. This process is
sometimes called **cloning**, to avoid the ambiguity of the word copy.

The easiest way to clone a list is to use the slice operator.

Taking any slice of ``a`` creates a new list. In this case the slice happens to
consist of the whole list.

.. codelens:: chp09_is4
    :showoutput:
    
    a = [81,82,83]

    b = a[:]       # make a clone using slice
    print(a == b)
    print(a is b)

    b[0] = 5

    print(a)
    print(b)

Now we are free to make changes to ``b`` without worrying about ``a``.  Again, we can clearly see in codelens that ``a`` and ``b`` are entirely different list objects.
