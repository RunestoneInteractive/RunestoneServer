Which is Better?
----------------

Anything that can be done with modifiers can also be done with pure functions.
In fact, some programming languages only allow pure functions. There is some
evidence that programs that use pure functions are faster to develop and less
error-prone than programs that use modifiers. Nevertheless, modifiers are
convenient at times, and in some cases, functional programs are less efficient.

In general, we recommend that you write pure functions whenever it is
reasonable to do so and resort to modifiers only if there is a compelling
advantage. This approach might be called a *functional programming style*.
