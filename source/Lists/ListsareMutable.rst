Lists are Mutable
-----------------

Unlike strings, lists are **mutable**.  This means we can change an item in a list by accessing
it directly as part of the assignment statement. Using the indexing operator (square brackets) on the left side of an assignment, we can
update one of the list items.

.. activecode:: ch09_7
    
    fruit = ["banana", "apple", "cherry"]
    print(fruit)

    fruit[0] = "pear"
    fruit[-1] = "orange"
    print(fruit)


An
assignment to an element of a list is called **item assignment**. Item
assignment does not work for strings.  Recall that strings are immutable.

Here is the same example in codelens so that you can step thru the statements and see the changes to the list elements.

.. codelens:: item_assign
    
    fruit = ["banana", "apple", "cherry"]

    fruit[0] = "pear"
    fruit[-1] = "orange"



By combining assignment with the slice operator we can update several elements at once.

.. activecode:: ch09_8
    
    alist = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
    alist[1:3] = ['x', 'y']
    print(alist)

We can also remove elements from a list by assigning the empty list to them.

.. activecode:: ch09_9
    
    alist = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
    alist[1:3] = []
    print(alist)

We can even insert elements into a list by squeezing them into an empty slice at the
desired location.

.. activecode:: ch09_10
    
    alist = ['a', 'd', 'f']
    alist[1:1] = ['b', 'c']
    print(alist)
    alist[4:4] = ['e']
    print(alist)

**Check your understanding**

.. mchoicemf:: test_question9_7_1
   :answer_a: [4,2,True,8,6,5]
   :answer_b: [4,2,True,6,5]
   :answer_c: Error, it is illegal to assign
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Item assignment does not insert the new item into the list.
   :feedback_b: Yes, the value True is placed in the list at index 2.  It replaces 8.
   :feedback_c: Item assignment is allowed with lists.  Lists are mutable.
   
   What is printed by the following statements?
   
   .. code-block:: python

     alist = [4,2,8,6,5]
     alist[2] = True
     print(alist)


.. index:: del statement, statement; del
