Repetition and References
-------------------------

We have already seen the repetition operator working on strings as well as lists.  For example, 

.. activecode:: repref1

    origlist = [45, 76, 34, 55]
    print(origlist*3)

With a list, the repetition operator creates copies of the references.  Although this may seem simple enough, when we allow a list to refer to another list, a subtle problem can arise.

Consider the following extension on the previous example.

.. activecode:: repref2

    origlist = [45, 76, 34, 55]
    print(origlist*3)

    newlist = [origlist] * 3

    print(newlist)

``newlist`` is a list of three references to ``origlist`` that were created by the repetition operator.  The reference diagram is shown below.

   :alt: Repetition of a nested list




Now, what happens if we modify a value in ``origlist``.


.. activecode:: repref3

    origlist = [45, 76, 34, 55]

    newlist = [origlist] * 3

    print(newlist)

    origlist[1] = 99

    print(newlist)

``newlist`` shows the change in three places.  This can easily be seen by noting that in the reference diagram, there is only one ``origlist``, so any changes to it appear in all three references from ``newlist``.

   :alt: Same reference

Here is the same example in codelens.  Step through the code until paying particular attention to the result of executing the assignment statement ``origlist[1] = 99``.

.. codelens:: reprefstep
    :showoutput:

    origlist = [45, 76, 34, 55]

    newlist = [origlist] * 3

    print(newlist)

    origlist[1] = 99

    print(newlist)

   What is printed by the following statements?
   
   .. code-block:: python

     alist = [4,2,8,6,5]
     blist = alist * 2
     blist[3] = 999
     print(alist)

   :answer_c: [4,2,8,6,5]
   :answer_d: [[4,2,8,999,5],[4,2,8,6,5]]
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: [alist] * 2 creates a list containing alist repeated 2 times
   :feedback_b: Yes, blist contains two references, both to alist.
   :feedback_c: print(blist)
   :feedback_d: blist contains two references, both to alist so changes to alist appear both times.
   
   What is printed by the following statements?
   
   .. code-block:: python

     alist = [4,2,8,6,5]
