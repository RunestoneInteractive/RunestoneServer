        .. tab:: Question

           Add a ``distanceFromPoint`` method that works similar to ``distanceFromOrigin`` except that it 
           takes a ``Point`` as a parameter and
           computes the distance between that point and self.

#. Add a method ``reflect_x`` to Point which returns a new Point, one which is the 
   reflection of the point about the x-axis.  For example, 
   ``Point(3, 5).reflect_x()`` is (3, -5)

        .. tab:: Question

           Add a method ``slope_from_origin`` which returns the slope of the line joining the origin
           to the point.   For example, ::
           
              >>> Point(4, 10).slope_from_origin()
              2.5     
              
           What cases will cause your method to fail? Return None when it happens.

#. The equation of a straight line is  "y = ax + b", (or perhaps "y = mx + c").
   The coefficients a and b completely describe the line.  Write a method in the 
   Point class so that if a point instance is given another point, it will compute the equation
   of the straight line joining the two points.  It must return the two coefficients as a tuple
   of two values.  For example,   ::
   
      >>> print(Point(4, 11).get_line_to(Point(6, 15))) 
      >>> (2, 3)
 
   This tells us that the equation of the line joining the two points is "y = 2x + 3".    
   When will your method fail?

        .. tab:: Question

           Add a method called ``move`` that will take two parameters, call them ``dx`` and ``dy``.  The method will
           cause the point to move in the x and y direction the number of units given. (Hint: you will change the values of the
           state of the point)
