Improving our Constructor
------------------------- 

Our constructor so far can only create points at location ``(0,0)``.  To create a point at position (7, 6) requires that we
provide some additional capability for the user to pass information to the constructor.  Since constructors are simply specially named functions, we can use parameters (as we've seen before) to provide the specific information.
    
We can make our class constructor more general by putting extra parameters into
the ``__init__`` method, as shown in this example.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    class Point:
        """ Point class for representing and manipulating x,y coordinates. """
        
        def __init__(self, initX, initY):
 
            self.x = initX
            self.y = initY
    
    p = Point(7,6)



Now when we create new points, we supply the x and y coordinates as parameters.  When the point is created, the values of ``initX`` and ``initY`` are assigned to the state of the object.
