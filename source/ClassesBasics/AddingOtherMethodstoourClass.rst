Adding Other Methods to our Class
---------------------------------
          
The key advantage of using a class like ``Point`` rather than something like a simple
tuple ``(7, 6)`` now becomes apparent.  We can add methods to
the ``Point`` class that are sensible operations for points.  Had we chosen to use a simple
tuple to represent the point, we would not have this capability.
Creating a class like ``Point`` brings an exceptional
amount of "organizational power" to our programs, and to our thinking. 
We can group together the sensible operations, and the kinds of data 
they apply to, and each instance of the class can have its own state.       
          
A **method** behaves like a function but it is invoked on a specific
instance.  For example, with a turtle named ``tess``,  ``tess.right(90)`` asks the ``tess`` object to perform its
``right`` method and turn 90 degrees.   Methods are accessed using dot notation.  

Let's add two simple methods to allow a point to give us information about its state.  The ``getX`` method, when invoked, will return the value of the x coordinate.  The implementation of this method is straight forward since we already know how
to write functions that return values.  One thing to notice is that even though the ``getX`` method does not need any other parameter information to do its work, there is still one formal parameter, ``self``.  As we stated earlier, all methods defined in a class that operate on objects of that class will have ``self`` as their first parameter.  Again, this serves as reference to the object itself which in turn gives access to the state data inside the object.

.. activecode:: chp13_classes4
    
    class Point:
        """ Point class for representing and manipulating x,y coordinates. """
        
        def __init__(self, initX, initY):
 
            self.x = initX
            self.y = initY

        def getX(self):
            return self.x

        def getY(self):
            return self.y

    
    p = Point(7,6)
    print(p.getX())
    print(p.getY())

Note that the ``getX`` method simply returns the value of ``self.x`` from the object itself.  In other words, the implementation of the method is to go to the state of the object itself and get the value of ``x``.  Likewise, the ``getY`` method looks the same.

Let's add another method, ``distanceFromOrigin``, to see better how methods
work.  This method will again not need any additional information to do its work.
It will perform a more complex task.


.. activecode:: chp13_classes5
    
    class Point:
        """ Point class for representing and manipulating x,y coordinates. """
        
        def __init__(self, initX, initY):
 
            self.x = initX
            self.y = initY

        def getX(self):
            return self.x

        def getY(self):
            return self.y

        def distanceFromOrigin(self):
            return ((self.x ** 2) + (self.y ** 2)) ** 0.5

    
    p = Point(7,6)
    print(p.distanceFromOrigin())



Notice that the caller of ``distanceFromOrigin`` does not explicitly 
supply an argument to match the ``self`` parameter.  This is true of all method calls. The definition will always
have one additional parameter as compared to the invocation.
