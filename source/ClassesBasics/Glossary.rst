.. glossary::


    attribute
        One of the named data items that makes up an instance.

    class
        A user-defined compound type. A class can also be thought of as a
        template for the objects that are instances of it.
        
    constructor
        Every class has a "factory", called by the same name as the class, for
        making new instances.  If the class has an *initializer method*, this method
        is used to get the attributes (i.e. the state) of the new object properly set up. 
            
    initializer method
        A special method in Python (called ``__init__``) 
        that is invoked automatically to set a newly created object's
        attributes to their initial (factory-default) state.
        
    instance
        An object whose type is of some class.  Instance and object are used
        interchangeably.
        
    instantiate
        To create an instance of a class, and to run its initializer. 
        
    method
        A function that is defined inside a class definition and is invoked on
        instances of that class. 

    object
        A compound data type that is often used to model a thing or concept in
        the real world.  It bundles together the data and the operations that 
        are relevant for that kind of data.  Instance and object are used
        interchangeably.

    object-oriented programming
        A powerful style of programming in which data and the operations 
        that manipulate it are organized into classes and methods.        

    object-oriented language
        A language that provides features, such as user-defined classes and
        inheritance, that facilitate object-oriented programming.
