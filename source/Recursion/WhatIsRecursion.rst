What Is Recursion?
------------------

**Recursion** is a method of solving problems that involves breaking a
problem down into smaller and smaller subproblems until you get to a
small enough problem that it can be solved trivially. Usually recursion
involves a function calling itself. While it may not seem like much on
the surface, recursion allows us to write elegant solutions to problems
that may otherwise be very difficult to program.
