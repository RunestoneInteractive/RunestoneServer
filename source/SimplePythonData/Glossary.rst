    assignment statement
        A statement that assigns a value to a name (variable). To the left of
        the assignment operator, ``=``, is a name. To the right of the
        assignment token is an expression which is evaluated by the Python
        interpreter and then assigned to the name. The difference between the
        left and right hand sides of the assignment statement is often
        confusing to new programmers. In the following assignment:

        .. sourcecode:: python

             n = n + 1

        ``n`` plays a very different role on each side of the ``=``. On the
        right it is a *value* and makes up part of the *expression* which will
        be evaluated by the Python interpreter before assigning it to the name
        on the left.

    assignment token
        ``=`` is Python's assignment token, which should not be confused
        with the mathematical comparison operator using the same symbol.

    class
		see **data type** below

    comment
        Information in a program that is meant for other programmers (or anyone
        reading the source code) and has no effect on the execution of the
        program.

    data type
        A set of values. The type of a value determines how it can be used in
        expressions. So far, the types you have seen are integers (``int``),
        floating-point numbers (``float``), and strings (``str``).

    decrement
        Decrease by 1.


    evaluate
        To simplify an expression by performing the operations in order to
        yield a single value.

    expression
        A combination of operators and operands (variables and values) that represents a
        single result value.  Expressions are evaluated to give that result.

    float
        A Python data type which stores *floating-point* numbers.
        Floating-point numbers are stored internally in two parts: a *base* and
        an *exponent*. When printed in the standard format, they look like
        decimal numbers. Beware of rounding errors when you use ``float``\ s,
        and remember that they are only approximate values.

    increment
        Both as a noun and as a verb, increment means to increase by 1.

    initialization (of a variable)
        To initialize a variable is to give it an initial value.
        Since in Python variables don't exist
        until they are assigned values, they are initialized when they are
        created.  In other programming languages this is not the case, and
        variables can be created without being initialized, in which case they
        have either default or *garbage* values.

    int
        A Python data type that holds positive and negative **whole** numbers.

    integer division
        An operation that divides one integer by another and yields an integer.
        Integer division yields only the whole number of times that the
        numerator is divisible by the denominator and discards any remainder.

    keyword
        A reserved word that is used by the compiler to parse program; you
        cannot use keywords like ``if``, ``def``, and ``while`` as variable
        names.

    modulus operator
		Also called remainder operator or integer remainder operator.  Gives the remainder after performing integer division.

    object
		Also known as a data object (or data value).  The fundamental things that programs are designed to
		manipulate (or that programmers ask to do things for them).

    operand
        One of the values on which an operator operates.

    operator
        A special symbol that represents a simple computation like addition,
        multiplication, or string concatenation.

    prompt string
		Used during interactive input to provide the use with hints as to what type of value to enter.

    reference diagram
        A picture showing a variable with an arrow pointing to the value (object) that the variable refers to. See also **state snapshot**.

    rules of precedence
        The set of rules governing the order in which expressions involving
        multiple operators and operands are evaluated.

    state snapshot
        A graphical representation of a set of variables and the values to
        which they refer, taken at a particular instant during the program's
        execution.

    statement
        An instruction that the Python interpreter can execute.  So far we have
        only seen the assignment statement, but we will soon meet the
        ``import`` statement and the ``for`` statement.

    str
        A Python data type that holds a string of characters.

    type conversion function
		A function that can convert a data value from one type to another.

    value
        A number or string (or other things to be named later) that can be
        stored in a variable or computed in an expression.

    variable
        A name that refers to a value.

    variable name
        A name given to a variable. Variable names in Python consist of a
        sequence of letters (a..z, A..Z, and _) and digits (0..9) that begins
        with a letter.  In best programming practice, variable names should be
        chosen so that they describe their use in the program, making the
        program *self documenting*.
