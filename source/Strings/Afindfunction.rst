A ``find`` function
-------------------

Here is an implementation for the ``find`` method.

.. activecode:: ch08_run3
    
    def find(astring, achar):
        """
          Find and return the index of achar in astring.  
          Return -1 if achar does not occur in astring.
        """
        ix = 0
        found = False
        while ix < len(astring) and not found:
            if astring[ix] == achar:
                found = True
            else:
                ix = ix + 1
        if found:
            return ix
        else:
            return -1
        
    print(find("Compsci", "p"))
    print(find("Compsci", "C"))
    print(find("Compsci", "i"))
    print(find("Compsci", "x"))
    

In a sense, ``find`` is the opposite of the indexing operator. Instead of taking
an index and extracting the corresponding character, it takes a character and
finds the index where that character appears for the first time. If the character is not found,
the function returns ``-1``.

The ``while`` loop in this example uses a slightly more complex condition than we have seen
in previous programs.  Here there are two parts to the condition.  We want to keep going if there
are more characters to look through and we want to keep going if we have not found what we are 
looking for.  The variable ``found`` is a boolean variable that keeps track of whether we have found
the character we are searching for.  It is initialized to *False*.  If we find the character, we
reassign ``found`` to *True*.

The other part of the condition is the same as we used previously to traverse the characters of the
string.  Since we have now combined these two parts with a logical ``and``, it is necessary for them
both to be *True* to continue iterating.  If one part fails, the condition fails and the iteration stops.

When the iteration stops, we simply ask a question to find out why and then return the proper value.

.. note::

	This pattern of computation is sometimes called a eureka traversal because as
	soon as we find what we are looking for, we can cry Eureka!  and stop looking.  The way
	we stop looking is by setting ``found`` to True which causes the condition to fail.
