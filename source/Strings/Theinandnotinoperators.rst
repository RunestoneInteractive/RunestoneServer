The ``in`` and ``not in`` operators
-----------------------------------

The ``in`` operator tests if one string is a substring of another:

.. activecode:: chp8_in1
    
    print('p' in 'apple')
    print('i' in 'apple')
    print('ap' in 'apple')
    print('pa' in 'apple')

Note that a string is a substring of itself, and the empty string is a 
substring of any other string. (Also note that computer scientists 
like to think about these edge cases quite carefully!) 

.. activecode:: chp8_in2
    
    print('a' in 'a')
    print('apple' in 'apple')
    print('' in 'a')
    print('' in 'apple')
    
The ``not in`` operator returns the logical opposite result of ``in``.

.. activecode:: chp8_in3

    print('x' not in 'apple')
