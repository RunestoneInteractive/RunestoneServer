Index Operator: Working with the Characters of a String
-------------------------------------------------------

The **indexing operator** (Python uses square brackets to enclose the index) 
selects a single character from a string.  The characters are accessed by their position or 
index value.  For example, in the string shown below, the 14 characters are indexed left to right from postion 0 to position 13.  


.. image:: Figures/indexvalues.png
   :alt: index values

It is also the case that the positions are named from right to left using negative numbers where -1 is the rightmost
index and so on.
Note that the character at index 6 (or -8) is the blank character.


.. activecode:: chp08_index1
    
    school = "Luther College"
    m = school[2]
    print(m)
    
    lastchar = school[-1]
    print(lastchar)

The expression ``school[2]`` selects the character at index 2 from ``school``, and creates a new
string containing just this one character. The variable ``m`` refers to the result. 

Remember that computer scientists often start counting
from zero. The letter at index zero of ``"Luther College"`` is ``L``.  So at
position ``[2]`` we have the letter ``t``.

If you want the zero-eth letter of a string, you just put 0, or any expression
with the value 0, in the brackets.  Give it a try.

The expression in brackets is called an **index**. An index specifies a member
of an ordered collection.  In this case the collection of characters in the string. The index
*indicates* which character you want. It can be any integer
expression so long as it evaluates to a valid index value.

Note that indexing returns a *string* --- Python has no special type for a single character.
It is just a string of length 1.

   :feedback_b: Yes, index locations start with 0.
   :feedback_c: s[-3] would return c, counting from right to left.
   :feedback_d: [ ] is the index operator

   :feedback_a: Yes, indexing operator has precedence over concatenation.
   :feedback_b: p is at location 0, not 2.
   :feedback_c: n is at location 5, not 2.
   :feedback_d: [ ] operator returns a string that can be concatenated with another string.
