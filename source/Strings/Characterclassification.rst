Character classification
------------------------

It is often helpful to examine a character and test whether it is upper- or
lowercase, or whether it is a character or a digit. The ``string`` module
provides several constants that are useful for these purposes. One of these,
``string.digits`` is equivalent to "0123456789".  It can be used to check if a character
is a digit using the ``in`` operator.

The string ``string.ascii_lowercase`` contains all of the ascii letters that the system
considers to be lowercase. Similarly, ``string.ascii_uppercase`` contains all of the
uppercase letters. ``string.punctuation`` comprises all the characters considered
to be punctuation. Try the following and see what you get.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    print(string.ascii_lowercase)
    print(string.ascii_uppercase)
    print(string.digits)
    print(string.punctuation)

    

For more information consult the ``string`` module documentaiton (see `Global Module Index <http://docs.python.org/py3k/py-modindex.html>`_).
