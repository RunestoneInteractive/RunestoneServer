    collection data type
        A data type in which the values are made up of components, or elements,
        that are themselves values.

    default value
        The value given to an optional parameter if no argument for it is
        provided in the function call.


    dot notation
        Use of the **dot operator**, ``.``, to access functions inside a
        module, or to access methods and attributes of an object.

    immutable
        A compound data type whose elements can not be assigned new values.

    index
        A variable or value used to select a member of an ordered collection, such as
        a character from a string, or an element from a list.

    optional parameter
        A parameter written in a function header with an assignment to a
        default value which it will receive if no corresponding argument is
        given for it in the function call.

    slice
        A part of a string (substring) specified by a range of indices. More
        generally, a subsequence of any sequence type in Python can be created
        using the slice operator (``sequence[start:stop]``).

    traverse
        To iterate through the elements of a collection, performing a similar
        operation on each.

    whitespace
        Any of the characters that move the cursor without printing visible
        characters. The constant ``string.whitespace`` contains all the
        white-space characters.
