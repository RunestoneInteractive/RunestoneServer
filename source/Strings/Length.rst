The ``len`` function, when applied to a string, returns the number of characters in a string.

.. activecode:: chp08_len1
    
    fruit = "Banana"
    print(len(fruit))
    

To get the last letter of a string, you might be tempted to try something like
this:

.. activecode:: chp08_len2
    
    fruit = "Banana"
    sz = len(fruit)
    last = fruit[sz]       # ERROR!
    print(last)

That won't work. It causes the runtime error
``IndexError: string index out of range``. The reason is that there is no
letter at index position 6 in ``"Banana"``. 
Since we started counting at zero, the six indexes are
numbered 0 to 5. To get the last character, we have to subtract 1 from
``length``.  Give it a try in the example above.

.. activecode:: ch08_len3
    
    fruit = "Banana"
    sz = len(fruit)
    lastch = fruit[sz-1]
    print(lastch)

.. Alternatively, we can use **negative indices**, which count backward from the
.. end of the string. The expression ``fruit[-1]`` yields the last letter,
.. ``fruit[-2]`` yields the second to last, and so on.  Try it!

Typically, a Python programmer will access the last character by combining the
two lines of code from above.


.. sourcecode:: python
    
    lastch = fruit[len(fruit)-1]

.. mchoicemf:: test_question8_4_1
   :answer_a: 11
   :answer_b: 12
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: The blank counts as a character.
   :feedback_b: Yes, there are 12 characters in the string.


   What is printed by the following statements?
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
      s = "python rocks"
      print(len(s))



.. mchoicemf:: test_question8_4_2
   :answer_a: o
   :answer_b: r
   :answer_c: s
   :answer_d: Error, len(s) is 12 and there is no index 12.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Take a look at the index calculation again, len(s)-5.
   :feedback_b: Yes, len(s) is 12 and 12-5 is 7.  Use 7 as index and remember to start counting with 0.
   :feedback_c: s is at index 11
   :feedback_d: You subtract 5 before using the index operator so it will work.
