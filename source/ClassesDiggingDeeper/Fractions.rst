Fractions
---------

We have all had to work with fractions when we were younger.  Or, perhaps you do a lot of cooking and have to
manage measurements for ingredients.  In any case, fractions are something that we are familiar with.
In this chapter we will develop a class to represent a fraction including some of the most common methods that we
would like fractions to be able to do.

A fraction is most commonly thought of as two integers, one over the other, with a line separating them.  The number
on the top is called the numerator and the number on the bottom is called the denominator.  Sometimes people use a slash
for the line and sometimes they use a straight line.  The fact is that it really does not matter so long as you know which
is the numerator and which is the denominator.

To design our class, we simply need to use the analysis above to realize that the `state` of a fraction object can be 
completely described by representing two integers.  We can begin by implementing the ``Fraction`` class and the ``__init__``
method which will allow the user to provide a numerator and a denominator for the fraction being created.



.. activecode:: fractions_init

    class Fraction:

        def __init__(self,top,bottom):

            self.num = top        #the numerator is on top
            self.den = bottom     #the denominator is on the bottom

        def __str__(self):
            return str(self.num) + "/" + str(self.den)

        def getNum(self):
            return self.num

        def getDen(self):
            return self.den

    myfraction = Fraction(3,4)
    print(myfraction)

    print(myfraction.getNum())
    print(myfraction.getDen())



Note that the ``__str__`` method provides a "typical" looking fraction using a slash between the numerator and denominator.
The figure below shows the state of ``myfraction``.  We have also added a few simple accessor methods, ``getNum`` and ``getDen``, that can return the
state values for the fraction.
