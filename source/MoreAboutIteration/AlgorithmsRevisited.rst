Algorithms Revisited
--------------------

Newton's method is an example of an **algorithm**: it is a mechanical process
for solving a category of problems (in this case, computing square roots).

It is not easy to define an algorithm. It might help to start with something
that is not an algorithm. When you learned to multiply single-digit numbers,
you probably memorized the multiplication table.  In effect, you memorized 100
specific solutions. That kind of knowledge is not algorithmic.

But if you were lazy, you probably cheated by learning a few tricks.  For
example, to find the product of n and 9, you can write n - 1 as the first digit
and 10 - n as the second digit. This trick is a general solution for
multiplying any single-digit number by 9. That's an algorithm!

Similarly, the techniques you learned for addition with carrying, subtraction
with borrowing, and long division are all algorithms. One of the
characteristics of algorithms is that they do not require any intelligence to
carry out. They are mechanical processes in which each step follows from the
last according to a simple set of rules.

On the other hand, understanding that hard problems can be solved by step-by-step
algorithmic processess is one of the major simplifying breakthroughs that has
had enormous benefits.  So while the execution of the algorithm
may be boring and may require no intelligence, algorithmic or computational
thinking is having a vast impact.  It is the process of designing algorithms that is interesting,
intellectually challenging, and a central part of what we call programming.

Some of the things that people do naturally, without difficulty or conscious
thought, are the hardest to express algorithmically.  Understanding natural
language is a good example. We all do it, but so far no one has been able to
explain *how* we do it, at least not in the form of a step-by-step mechanical
algorithm.
