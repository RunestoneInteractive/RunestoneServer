The ``while`` Statement

There is another Python statement that can also be used to build an iteration.  It is called the ``while`` statement.
The ``while`` statement provides a much more general mechanism for iterating.  Similar to the ``if`` statement, it uses
a boolean expression to control the flow of execution.  The body of while will be repeated as long as the controlling boolean expression evaluates to ``True``.

The following figure shows the flow of control.

.. image:: Figures/while_flow.png

We can use the ``while`` loop to create any type of iteration we wish, including anything that we have previously done with a ``for`` loop.  For example, the program in the previous section could be rewritten using ``while``.
Instead of relying on the ``range`` function to produce the numbers for our summation, we will need to produce them ourselves.  To to this, we will create a variable called ``aNumber`` and initialize it to 1, the first number in the summation.  Every iteration will add ``aNumber`` to the running total until all the values have been used.
In order to control the iteration, we must create a boolean expression that evaluates to ``True`` as long as we want to keep adding values to our running total.  In this case, as long as ``aNumber`` is less than or equal to the bound, we should keep going.



Here is a new version of the summation program that uses a while statement.

.. activecode:: ch07_while1

    def sumTo(aBound):
        """ Return the sum of 1+2+3 ... n """

        theSum  = 0
        aNumber = 1
        while aNumber <= aBound:
            theSum = theSum + aNumber
            aNumber = aNumber + 1
        return theSum

    print(sumTo(4))

    print(sumTo(1000))



You can almost read the ``while`` statement as if it were in natural language. It means,
while ``aNumber`` is less than or equal to ``aBound``, continue executing the body of the loop. Within
the body, each time, update ``theSum`` using the accumulator pattern and increment ``aNumber``. After the body of the loop, we go back up to the condition of the ``while`` and reevaluate it.  When ``aNumber`` becomes greater than ``aBound``, the condition fails and flow of control continues to the ``return`` statement.

The same program in codelens will allow you to observe the flow of execution.

.. codelens:: ch07_while2

    def sumTo(aBound):
        """ Return the sum of 1+2+3 ... n """

        theSum  = 0
        aNumber = 1
        while aNumber <= aBound:
            theSum = theSum + aNumber
            aNumber = aNumber + 1
        return theSum

    print(sumTo(4))



.. note:: The names of the variables have been chosen to help readability.

More formally, here is the flow of execution for a ``while`` statement:

#. Evaluate the condition, yielding ``False`` or ``True``.
#. If the condition is ``False``, exit the ``while`` statement and continue
   execution at the next statement.
#. If the condition is ``True``, execute each of the statements in the body and
   then go back to step 1.

The body consists of all of the statements below the header with the same
indentation.

This type of flow is called a **loop** because the third step loops back around
to the top. Notice that if the condition is ``False`` the first time through the
loop, the statements inside the loop are never executed.

The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that
eventually the condition becomes ``False`` and the loop terminates. Otherwise the
loop will repeat forever. This is called an **infinite loop**.
An endless
source of amusement for computer scientists is the observation that the
directions written on the back of the shampoo bottle (lather, rinse, repeat) create an infinite loop.

In the case shown above, we can prove that the loop terminates because we
know that the value of ``aBound`` is finite, and we can see that the value of ``aNumber``
increments each time through the loop, so eventually it will have to exceed ``aBound``. In
other cases, it is not so easy to tell.

.. note::

	Introduction of the while statement causes us to think about the types of iteration we have seen.  The ``for`` statement will always iterate through a sequence of values like the list of names for the party or the list of numbers created by ``range``.  Since we know that it will iterate once for each value in the collection, it is often said that a ``for`` loop creates a
	**definite iteration** because we definitely know how many times we are going to iterate.  On the other
	hand, the ``while`` statement is dependent on a condition that needs to evaluate to ``False`` in order
	for the loop to terminate.  Since we do not necessarily know when this will happen, it creates what we
	call **indefinite iteration**.  Indefinite iteration simply means that we don't know how many times we will repeat but eventually the condition controlling the iteration will fail and the iteration will stop. (Unless we have an infinite loop which is of course a problem)

What you will notice here is that the ``while`` loop is more work for
you --- the programmer --- than the equivalent ``for`` loop.  When using a ``while``
loop you have to control the loop variable yourself.  You give it an initial value, test
for completion, and then make sure you change something in the body so that the loop
terminates.

So why have two kinds of loop if ``for`` looks easier?  This next example shows an indefinite iteration where
we need the extra power that we get from the ``while`` loop.

**Check your understanding**

.. mchoicemf:: test_question7_2_1
   :answer_a: True
   :answer_b: False
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Although the while loop uses a different syntax, it is just as powerful as a for-loop and often more flexible.
   :feedback_b: Often a for-loop is more natural and convenient for a task, but that same task can always be expressed using a while loop.

   True or False: You can rewrite any for-loop as a while-loop.

.. mchoicemf:: test_question7_2_2
   :answer_a: n starts at 10 and is incremented by 1 each time through the loop, so it will always be positive
   :answer_b: answer starts at 1 and is incremented by n each time, so it will always be positive
   :answer_c: You cannot compare n to 0 in while loop.  You must compare it to another variable.
   :answer_d: In the while loop body, we must set n to False, and this code does not do that.  
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: The loop will run as long as n is positive.  In this case, we can see that n will never become non-positive.
   :feedback_b: While it is true that answer will always be positive, answer is not considered in the loop condition.
   :feedback_c: It is perfectly valid to compare n to 0.  Though indirectly, this is what causes the infinite loop.
   :feedback_d: The loop condition must become False for the loop to terminate, but n by itself is not the condition in this case.

   The following code contains an infinite loop.  Which is the best explanation for why the loop does not terminate?

   .. code-block:: python

     n = 10
     answer = 1
     while ( n > 0 ):
       answer = answer + n
       n = n + 1
     print answer
