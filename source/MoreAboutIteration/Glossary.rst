.. glossary::


    algorithm
        A step-by-step process for solving a category of problems.

    body
        The statements inside a loop.


    counter
        A variable used to count something, usually initialized to zero and
        incremented in the body of a loop.

    cursor
        An invisible marker that keeps track of where the next character will
        be printed.


    definite iteration
        A loop where we have an upper bound on the number of times the
        body will be executed.  Definite iteration is usually best coded
        as a ``for`` loop.



    escape sequence
        An escape character, \\, followed by one or more printable characters
        used to designate a nonprintable character.

    generalize
        To replace something unnecessarily specific (like a constant value)
        with something appropriately general (like a variable or parameter).
        Generalization makes code more versatile, more likely to be reused, and
        sometimes even easier to write.



    infinite loop
        A loop in which the terminating condition is never satisfied.

    indefinite iteration
        A loop where we just need to keep going until some condition is met.
        A ``while`` statement is used for this case.



    iteration
        Repeated execution of a set of programming statements.

    loop
        A statement or group of statements that execute repeatedly until a
        terminating condition is satisfied.

    loop variable
        A variable used as part of the terminating condition of a loop.


    

    nested loop
        A loop inside the body of another loop.

    newline
        A special character that causes the cursor to move to the beginning of
        the next line.


    reassignment
        Making more than one assignment to the same variable during the
        execution of a program.



     
    tab
        A special character that causes the cursor to move to the next tab stop
        on the current line.
