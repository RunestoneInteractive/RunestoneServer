Program Development
-------------------

At this point, you should be able to look at complete functions and tell what
they do. Also, if you have been doing the exercises, you have written some
small functions. As you write larger functions, you might start to have more
difficulty, especially with runtime and semantic errors.

To deal with increasingly complex programs, we are going to suggest a technique
called **incremental development**. The goal of incremental development is to
avoid long debugging sessions by adding and testing only a small amount of code
at a time.

As an example, suppose you want to find the distance between two points, given
by the coordinates (x\ :sub:`1`\ , y\ :sub:`1`\ ) and
(x\ :sub:`2`\ , y\ :sub:`2`\ ).  By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance is:

   :alt: Distance formula 

The first step is to consider what a ``distance`` function should look like in
Python. In other words, what are the inputs (parameters) and what is the output
(return value)?

In this case, the two points are the inputs, which we can represent using four
parameters. The return value is the distance, which is a floating-point value.

Already we can write an outline of the function that captures our thinking so far.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
        return 0.0

Obviously, this version of the function doesn't compute distances; it always
returns zero. But it is syntactically correct, and it will run, which means
that we can test it before we make it more complicated.

To test the new function, we call it with sample values.


.. activecode:: ch06_distance1
    
    def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
        return 0.0

    print(distance(1, 2, 4, 6))


We chose these values so that the horizontal distance equals 3 and the vertical
distance equals 4; that way, the result is 5 (the hypotenuse of a 3-4-5
triangle). When testing a function, it is useful to know the right answer.

At this point we have confirmed that the function is syntactically correct, and
we can start adding lines of code. After each incremental change, we test the
function again. If an error occurs at any point, we know where it must be --- in
the last line we added.

A logical first step in the computation is to find the differences
x\ :sub:`2`\ - x\ :sub:`1`\  and y\ :sub:`2`\ - y\ :sub:`1`\ .  We will store
those values in temporary variables named ``dx`` and ``dy``.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
        dx = x2 - x1
        dy = y2 - y1
        return 0.0


Next we compute the sum of squares of ``dx`` and ``dy``.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
        dx = x2 - x1
        dy = y2 - y1
        dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2
        return 0.0

Again, we could run the program at this stage and check the value of ``dsquared`` (which
should be 25).

Finally, using the fractional exponent ``0.5`` to find the square root,
we compute and return the result.

.. activecode:: ch06_distancefinal
    
    def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
        dx = x2 - x1
        dy = y2 - y1
        dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2
        result = dsquared**0.5
        return result

    print(distance(1, 2, 4, 6))


If that works correctly, you are done. Otherwise, you might want to print the
value of ``result`` before the return statement.

When you start out, you might add only a line or two of code at a time. As you
gain more experience, you might find yourself writing and debugging bigger
conceptual chunks. As you improve your programming skills you should find yourself
managing bigger and bigger chunks: this is very similar to the way we learned to read
letters, syllables, words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, etc., or the way we learn
to chunk music --- from indvidual notes to chords, bars, phrases, and so on.  

The key aspects of the process are:

#. Start with a working skeleton program and make small incremental changes. At any
   point, if there is an error, you will know exactly where it is.
#. Use temporary variables to hold intermediate values so that you can easily inspect
   and check them.
#. Once the program is working, you might want to consolidate multiple statements 
   into compound expressions,
   but only do this if it does not make the program more difficult to read.
