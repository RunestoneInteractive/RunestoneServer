Functions that return values
----------------------------

Most functions require arguments, values that control how the function does its
job. For example, if you want to find the absolute value of a number, you have
to indicate what the number is. Python has a built-in function for computing
the absolute value:

.. activecode:: ch04_4
    :nocanvas:

    print(abs(5))

    print(abs(-5))

In this example, the arguments to the ``abs`` function are 5 and -5.


Some functions take more than one argument. For example the math module contains a function
called
``pow`` which takes two arguments, the base and the exponent.

.. Inside the function,
.. the values that are passed get assigned to variables called **parameters**.

.. activecode:: ch04_5
    :nocanvas:

    import math
    print(math.pow(2, 3))

    print(math.pow(7, 4))

.. note::

     Of course, we have already seen that raising a base to an exponent can be done with the ** operator.

Another built-in function that takes more than one argument is ``max``.

.. activecode:: ch04_6
    :nocanvas:

    print(max(7, 11))
    print(max(4, 1, 17, 2, 12))
    print(max(3 * 11, 5**3, 512 - 9, 1024**0))

``max`` can be sent any number of arguments, separated by commas, and will
return the maximum value sent. The arguments can be either simple values or
expressions. In the last example, 503 is returned, since it is larger than 33,
125, and 1.  Note that ``max`` also works on lists of values.

Furthermore, functions like ``range``, ``int``, ``abs`` all return values that
can be used to build more complex expressions.

So an important difference between these functions and one like ``drawSquare`` is that
``drawSquare`` was not executed because we wanted it to compute a value --- on the contrary,
we wrote ``drawSquare`` because we wanted it to execute a sequence of steps that caused
the turtle to draw a specific shape.

Functions that return values are sometimes called **fruitful functions**.
In many other languages, a chunk that doesn't return a value is called a **procedure**,
but we will stick here with the Python way of also calling it a function, or if we want
to stress it, a *non-fruitful* function.


Fruitful functions still allow the user to provide information (arguments).  However there is now an additional
piece of data that is returned from the function.

.. image:: Figures/blackboxfun.png


How do we write our own fruitful function?  Lets start by creating a very simple
mathematical function that we will call ``square``.  The square function will take one number
as a parameter and return the result of squaring that number.  Here is the
black-box diagram with the Python code following.


.. image:: Figures/squarefun.png

.. activecode:: ch04_square

    def square(x):
        y = x * x
        return y

    toSquare = 10
    result = square(toSquare)
    print("The result of ", toSquare, " squared is ", result)

The **return** statement is followed by an expression which is evaluated.  Its
result is returned to the caller as the "fruit" of calling this function.
Because the return statement can contain any Python expression we could have
avoided creating the **temporary variable** ``y`` and simply used
``return x*x``.
Try modifying the square function above to see that this works just the same.
On the other hand, using **temporary variables** like ``y`` in the program above makes
debugging
easier.  These temporary variables are referred to as **local variables**.

.. The line `toInvest = float(input("How much do you want to invest?"))`
..  also shows yet another example
..  of *composition* --- we can call a function like `float`, and its arguments
 .. can be the results of other function calls (like `input`) that we've called along the way.

Notice something important here. The name of the variable we pass as an
argument --- ``toSquare`` --- has nothing to do with the name of the formal parameter
--- ``x``.  It is as if  ``x = toSquare`` is executed when ``square`` is called.
It doesn't matter what the value was named in
the caller. In ``square``, it's name is ``x``.  You can see this very clearly in
codelens, where the global variables and the local variables for the square
function are in separate boxes.

As you step through the example in codelens notice that the **return** statement not only causes the
function to return a value, but it also returns the flow of control back to the place in the program
where the function call was made.



.. codelens:: ch04_clsquare

    def square(x):
        y = x * x
        return y

    toSquare = 10
    squareResult = square(toSquare)
    print("The result of ", toSquare, " squared is ", squareResult)

Another important thing to notice as you step through this codelens
demonstration is the movement of the red and green arrows.  Codelens uses these arrows to show you where it is currently executing.
Recall that the red arrow always points to the next line of code that will be executed.  The light green arrow points to the line
that was just executed in the last step.

When you first start running this codelens demonstration you will notice that there is only a red arrow and it points to
line 1.  This is because line 1 is the next line to be executed and since it is the first line, there is no previously executed line
of code.  

When you click on the forward button, notice that the red arrow moves to line 5, skipping lines 2 and 3 of the function (and
the light green arrow has now appeared on line 1).  Why is this?
The answer is that function definition is not the same as function execution.  Lines 2
and 3 will not be executed until the function is called on line 6.  Line 1 defines the function and the name ``square`` is added to the
global variables, but that is all the ``def`` does at that point.  The body of the function will be executed later.  Continue to click
the forward button to see how the flow of control moves from the call, back up to the body of the function, and then finally back to line 7, after the function has returned its value and the value has been assigned to ``squareResult``.


.. Short variable names are more economical and sometimes make
.. code easier to read:
.. E = mc\ :sup:`2` would not be nearly so memorable if Einstein had
.. used longer variable names!  If you do prefer short names,
.. make sure you also have some comments to enlighten the reader
.. about what the variables are used for.


Finally, there is one more aspect of function return values that should be noted.  All Python functions return the value ``None`` unless there is an explicit return statement with
a value other than ``None.``
Consider the following common mistake made by beginning Python
programmers.  As you step through this example, pay very close attention to the return
value in the local variables listing.  Then look at what is printed when the
function returns.


.. codelens:: ch04_clsquare_bad

    def square(x):
        y = x * x
        print(y)   # Bad! should use return instead!

    toSquare = 10
    squareResult = square(toSquare)
    print("The result of ", toSquare, " squared is ", squareResult)

The problem with this function is that even though it prints the value of the square, that value will not be returned to the place
where the call was done.  Since line 6 uses the return value as the right hand side of an assignment statement, the evaluation of the 
function will be ``None``.  In this case, ``squareResult`` will refer to that value after the assignment statement and therefore the result printed in line 7 is incorrect.  Typically, functions will return values that can be printed or processed in some other way by the caller.

.. index::
    single: local variable
    single: variable; local
    single: lifetime





**Check your understanding**

.. mchoicemf:: test_question5_2_1
   :answer_a: You should never use a print statement in a function definition.
   :answer_b: You should not have any statements in a function after the return statement.  Once the function gets to the return statement it will immediately stop executing the function.
   :answer_c: You must calculate the value of x+y+z before you return it.
   :answer_d: A function cannot return a number.
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Although you should not mistake print for return, you may include print statements inside your functions.
   :feedback_b: This is a very common mistake so be sure to watch out for it when you write your code!
   :feedback_c: Python will automatically calculate the value x+y+z and then return it in the statement as it is written
   :feedback_d: Functions can return any legal data, including (but not limited to) numbers, strings, turtles, etc.

   What is wrong with the following function definition:

   .. code-block:: python

     def addEm(x, y, z):
         return x+y+z
         print('the answer is', x+y+z)


.. mchoicemf:: test_question5_2_2
   :answer_a: Nothing (no value)
   :answer_b: The value of x+y+z
   :answer_c: The string 'x+y+z'
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: We have accidentally used print where we mean return.  Therefore, the function will return the value None by default.  This is a VERY COMMON mistake so watch out!  This mistake is also particularly difficult to find because when you run the function the output looks the same.  It is not until you try to assign its value to a variable that you can notice a difference.
   :feedback_b: Careful!  This is a very common mistake.  Here we have printed the value x+y+z but we have not returned it.  To return a value we MUST use the return keyword.
   :feedback_c: x+y+z calculates a number (assuming x+y+z are numbers) which represents the sum of the values x, y and z.

   What will the following function return?

   .. code-block:: python

    def addEm(x, y, z):
        print(x+y+z)
