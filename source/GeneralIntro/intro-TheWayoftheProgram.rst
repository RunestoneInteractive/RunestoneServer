Introduction: The Way of the Program
======================

The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This
way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering,
and natural science. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal
languages to denote ideas (specifically computations). Like engineers, they
design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs
among alternatives.  Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex
systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.

The single most important skill for a computer scientist is **problem
solving**. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think
creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As
it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to
practice problem solving skills. That's why this chapter is called, *The Way of
the Program*.

On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On
another level, you will use programming as a means to an end. As we go along,
that end will become clearer.
