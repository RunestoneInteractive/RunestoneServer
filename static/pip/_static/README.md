Parsons Programmin Puzzles
==========================

Parsons programming puzzles are a type of scaffolded program construction tasks where the learner is given a set of code
fragments, blocks of a single or multiple lines of code, and the task is to piece together a program from these.

In js-parsons, learners not only select and order but also indent code fragments. This variant of Parsons programming 
puzzles is called two-dimensional (2D) Parsons problems. In Python, code indentation has a semantic meaning, as an 
indented statement falls into the surrounding control structure, which has lower  indentation. That is, code blocks 
are deﬁned by indentation instead of start and end symbols like curly braces.
