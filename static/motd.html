<h4>Runestone Academy approved as 501(c)(3) nonprofit</h4>
<h4>High School Teachers:</h4>
<p>
    If your school district wants us to sign a "contract" for providing please check to
    see if your district has adopted the
    <a href="https://privacy.a4l.org/national-dpa/">National Data Privacy Agreement</a>.
    If they have, then we can sign that and you are good to go. For many states we have
    already signed the NDPA and all you need to do is sign Exhibit E.

<h4>Please Support Runestone</h4>
<p>
    Did you know that over 70,000 students registered on Runestone Academy for the August
    2022 school year. At $100 a textbook we saved students $7 million this year! Thats a
    lot of students and a lot of savings. It takes a lot of work to keep this site up and
    growing. We are adding new features and improvements all the time. Please consider a
    <a href="/runestone/default/donate">donation</a> or ask your institution to support
    Runestone. If every school sent us $100 per class we would be fully sustainable and
    could add support staff.
</p>
<p>
    A huge <strong>Thank You!</strong> to those of you who have sent your support
    already.
