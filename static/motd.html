<h4>High School Teachers:</h4>
<p>We want you to use Runestone!  But before your school district sends me a contract to sign, please read <a href="https://runestoneinteractive.org/2021/05/28/data_privacy_agreements.html">This letter</a></p>
<h4>Planning for 2021/22?</h4>
<p>Several instructors have contacted me about budgeting for Runestone in
    the next school year! Thank you! If you are able to include any amount
    of support for Runestone in your budget for next year that would be
    awesome! Some departments have even added a $10/student lab fee to help support Runestone!
    I am happy to send you an invoice!</p>
<p>If you are curious about Runestone's finances, I am as transparent as possible.
    please see <a href="https://runestoneinteractive.org/2021/01/27/annual_report_2020.html">The Runestone Annual
        Report</a></p>

<p>Did you know that over 50,000 students have registered on Runestone Academy since August 1 2020!? At $100 a textbook
    we have
    saved students over $5 million! Thats a lot of students and a lot of savings. Please consider a <a
