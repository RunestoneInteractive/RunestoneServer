<h4>Runestone Academy approved as 501(c)(3) nonprofit</h4>
<h4>High School Teachers:</h4>
<p>
    If your school district wants us to sign a "contract" for providing you free access to Runestone academy we will now require a $100 US legal fee to review that contract.  There are many ways to use Runestone without us storing PII, so think about that as an option!

<h4>Please Support Runestone</h4>
<p>
    Did you know that over 50,000 students registered on Runestone Academy for the August
    2022 term. At $100 a textbook we saved students $5 million this semester! Thats
    a lot of students and a lot of savings. It takes a lot of work to keep this site up
    and growing. We are adding new features and improvements all the time. Please
    consider a
    <a href="/runestone/default/donate">donation</a> or ask your institution to support
    Runestone. If every school sent us $100 per class we would be fully sustainable and
    could add support staff.

<p>
    A huge <strong>Thank You!</strong> to those of you who have sent your support
    already.
