  <p id = "message2"> This may take several minutes to complete.
     When the course is finished you will be redirected to your new course.  Because you
     created the course you are set up as the instructor.</p>

    <p>Please -- If the build takes longer than 10 minutes Do NOT just try to build a new course.
       Please contact me by email at <a href="mailto:runestoneinteractive@gmail.com">RunestoneInteractive</a>.
        You can also try to access your course, by using a URL of the form:  <code>http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/&lt;yourcoursename&gt;/index.html</code>
        If you get an error message contact me by email and I will investigate and get your course built correctly.
    </p>
        <p>Due to memory limitations on the server I can only build one course at a time.  Sometimes the queue
        gets backed up or even temporarily stuck.  I will get things going again as quick as I can.
        Thanks for your patience.  -- Brad</p>
