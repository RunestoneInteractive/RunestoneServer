    <h1>Runestone Academy Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>Plain English</h2>
    <p>
        Runestone Academy has an educational mission. In this paragraph we provide our
        plain English view of your privacy and how we use your data when you visit our
        website (https://runstone.academy, the “Website”) to register your school or
        class as a user, when you register as a student of a school or class or access or
        use our educational services. The books and course materials we provide (the
        “Service”) are free-of-charge and in an open source format. They are for
        educational purposes only. As part of the Service or the Website we do collect
        usage data to help us better understand how you learn and how you use the Service
        and the Website . Because the Services may be used as a part of your formal
        education we need to collect some identifying information so that you can save
        and retrieve your work, and so that your instructor can register for the Service
        and assess your progress, grade, and give you feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may use the data we collect to make decisions about revisions to the Service,
        for academic research and to publish academic papers. We would never publish
        anything that knowingly revealed your identity. We may share this data with
        fellow educational researchers, or other partners that help further the mission
        of computer science education for everyone, but rest assured that any and all
        personally identifying information will be anonymized before we do. Other than
        that, we will take reasonable efforts to keep your data private and safe.
    </p>

    <p>
        All of the code used for the Service is available for you to inspect on
        <a href="https://github.com/RunestoneInteractive">GitHub.</a> The rest of this
        document is the detailed legal description of our policy. if you see something
        below that you think is not in the educational spirit of Runestone Interactive,
        please point it out so we can clarify it or change it.
