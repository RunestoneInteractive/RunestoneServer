# |docname| - Poetry configuration
# ********************************
# See the `Poetry docs <https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification/>`_ to get an understanding of
# how poetry does specifies dependencies.
#
# **Important**: Before running ``poetry install`` or ``poetry update``, run ``poetry-fix`` so that development dependencies will be installed correctly. See `runestone_poetry_project/poetry_fix.py`. Since this script isn't installed until the first run of ``poetry install``, run the script after the install then run ``poetry update`` again.
