# |docname| - Tools for building and using the Runestone Servers in Docker
# ************************************************************************
# This script provides a set of Docker-related command-line tools. Run ``docker-tools --help`` for details.

#
#
# Design goals
# ============
# - Bootstrap (the ``init command``): this script is designed to be downloaded then executed as a single file. In this case, bootstrap code downloads dependencies, the repo it belongs in, etc. This makes it easy to create a development or production environment from a fresh install of the host OS.
#
# - Multiple modes (the ``build command``): this script builds two distinctly different containers.
#
#   -   Single-container: these commands creates a container designed to execute on a single server. The Dockerized applications associated with it include Jobe, Redis, and Postgres. A volume is used to persist data, such as updates to the server.
#
#       -   Production mode (the default): ``docker-tool build --single`` creates a container designed for production (which includes obtaining an HTTPS certificate).
#
#       -   Development mode: ``docker-tools build --single-dev`` creates a container supporting a development mode, which provides additional tools and installs the BookServer and Runestone Components from github, instead of from releases on PyPI.
#
#   -   Multi-container: ``docker-tools build --multi`` creates a container designed for cluster operation, when many instances of this container accept requests passed on by a load balancer. In this mode, no volumes are mounted; HTTPS certificates cannot be requested, since this is the responsibility of the load balancer.
#
# - Flexible: the build process supports a number of options to customize the build. Writing in Python provides the ability to support this complexity.
#
# - Minimal: this tool only contains functions specifically related to Docker. Tools which apply more generally reside in `../rsmanage/toctree`.
#
# - No loops: unlike earlier approaches, this script doesn't cause the container to restart if something goes wrong. Instead, it catches all errors in a try/except block then stops executing so you can see what happened.
#
# - venv: all Python installs are placed in a virtual environment managed by Poetry.
#
#
# Build approach
# ==============
# To build a container, this script walks through three steps:
#
# #.    The first step occurs when this script is invoked from the terminal/command line, outside Docker. It does some preparation, then invokes the Docker build.
# #.    Next, Docker invokes this script from the `../Dockerfile`. This script installs everything it can.
# #.    Finally, Docker invokes this when the container is run. On the first run, this script completes container configuration, then runs the servers. After that, it only runs the servers, since the first-run configuration step is time-consuming.
#
# Since some files are built into the container in step 1 or run only once in step 2, simply editing a file in this repo may not update the file inside the container. Look through the source here to see which files this applies to.
#
#
# Imports and bootstrap
# =====================
# These are listed in the order prescribed by PEP 8, with exceptions noted below.
#
# There's a fair amount of bootstrap code here to download and install required imports and their dependencies.
