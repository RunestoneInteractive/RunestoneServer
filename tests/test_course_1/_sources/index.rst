Fill in the Blank
=================
.. fillintheblank:: test_fitb_string

    Fill in the blanks to make the following sentence: "The red car drove away."

    The |blank| car drove |blank|.

    -   :red: Correct.
        :x: Incorrect. Try 'red'.
    -   :away: Correct.
        :x: Incorrect. Try 'away'.


.. fillintheblank:: test_fitb_number

    .. If this isn't treated as a comment, then it will cause a **syntax error, thus producing a test failure.

    What is the solution to the following:

    :math:`2 * \pi =` |blank|.

    - :6.28 0.005: Good job.
      :3.27 3: Try higher.
      :9.29 3: Try lower.
      :.*: Incorrect. Try again.


.. fillintheblank:: test_fitb_regex_1
   :casei:

   Complete the sentence: |blank| had a |blank| lamb. One plus one is: (note that if there aren't enough blanks for the feedback given, they're added to the end of the problem. So, we don't **need** to specify a blank here.)

   -   :mary|Mair[a|e|i]: Correct.
       :Sue: Is wrong.
       :wrong: Try again. (Note: the last item of feedback matches anything, regardless of the string it's given.)
   -   :little: That's right.
       :.*: Nope.
   -   :0b10: Right on! Numbers can be given in decimal, hex (0x10 == 16), octal (0o10 == 8), binary (0b10 == 2), or using scientific notation (1e1 == 10), both here and by the user when answering the question.
       :2 1: Close.... (The second number is a tolerance, so this matches 1 or 3.)
       :x: Nope. (As earlier, this matches anything.)


.. fillintheblank:: test_fitb_regex_2
   :casei:

   Windows system files are stored in: |blank|.

   -   :C\:\\Windows\\system: Correct.
       :program files: Third party applications are stored here, not system files.
       :x: Try again.


.. fillintheblank:: test_fitb_regex_3
   :casei:

   Python lists are declared using: |blank|.

   -   :\[\]: Correct.
       :x: Try again.
